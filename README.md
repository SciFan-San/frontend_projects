# Frontend Projects

Welcome to my personal projects in frontend web development and design. Everything here will be publicly visible for the forseeable future. This repo is part of my exciting first steps to master git and will be mirrored between my GitHub and GitLab accounts ***more practice = more better*** :wink:.

## Expect: 
 - This repository to be more JS heavy, as a means to interact with HTML or CSS.
- See my foray into using JS frameworks like React, Next.js and Vue.js. 
- Wordpress and Figma related things (eventually).
- Designs to be okay, since I dont have a background in design.
- Lots of trial and error as I practice and hone my skill.
-  An eventual backend project repo for you to have a look at too. :relaxed:
